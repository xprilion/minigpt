# MiniGPT

This project is a minimal implementation of a GPT-like model for text generation, inspired by Andrej Karpathy's video series on building GPT from scratch. The entire implementation is contained within the `MiniGPT.ipynb` Jupyter notebook.

## Running the Code

1.  Open the `MiniGPT.ipynb` file in a Jupyter environment (like Jupyter Lab or Google Colab).
2.  Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to train the model and generate text.

## Dataset

The model is trained on the "Tiny Shakespeare" dataset, which is automatically downloaded when you run the notebook.
